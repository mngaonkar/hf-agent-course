[{"ty":"is","ibi":1,"s":"Brian Gracely (00:03.276)\nAnd we\u0027re back. And as I mentioned at the top of the show, I want to dive a little bit into some things I\u0027ve been reading, some discussions I\u0027ve had recently with various companies around, you know, kind of their deployments around AI, the things they\u0027ve learned in the early, you know, early months and maybe year that they\u0027ve been deploying some stuff and some of the sort of challenges and psychology that they\u0027re now starting to deal with as they become a little more familiar with the technology, familiar with usage patterns, familiar with how they\u0027re justifying cost, all those types of things.\n\nAnd I thought there was a couple of interesting things that were worth kind of talking about today. And I\u0027ll begin by sort of saying, you know, when we, when we think about, when we talked about most AI usages, most AI applications, especially as we\u0027ve sort of put them in the context of, you know, sort of enterprise business usage, not necessarily like just making an avatar for your social media or, you know, making a, you know, a fake video so that you can, you know, troll people on the internet, whatever that might be. but a lot of times, you know, the, the\n\nThe way if you were to sort of categorize them or the things that you\u0027ve seen from successes kind of fall into either kind of human augmentation, right? We\u0027re trying to help people be more efficient with what they do, relieve them of doing some of the kind of low value things, but allowing them to spend more time on stuff. So there\u0027s still very much people in the equation. And there\u0027s lots of examples of that. Developer Copilot\u0027s a great example of that. And then there\u0027s sort of another category of them that would be sort of human replacement.\n\nRight? So the goal is we have a task that if they sort of really mapped out what the task was, it could very much just be kind of completely automated. Right? In this case, we happen to be using AI technology to automate it. We hear examples of this of like, hey, we\u0027ve got a staff of people who do nothing but look at changes to legal documents, for example, or something related to their industry. Maybe it\u0027s changes to building codes or something. And they come out.\n\nwith a bunch of documents, there are hundreds of pages, they could now feed those into some sort of LLM. The LLM could summarize the changes without really having a human in the loop, So we see some of those types of things as well, and those fall more into the sort of human replacement category in terms of the task. I\u0027ll start with, if we think about it, technology has either augmented, shifted, or replaced human tasks for a while.\n\nBrian Gracely (02:30.21)\nRight, so this isn\u0027t necessarily anything new, right? Every one of us experienced this, maybe if you go to any sort of retail store and they allow you to now check out, do self-service checkout, right? You\u0027re able to bring your groceries and run it through the scanner and bag it and all that stuff, as opposed to going through the checkout person, right? That\u0027s a simple thing. We\u0027ve seen, you know, things like over time, farming equipment has become, you know, the technology around farming equipment has become more powerful, more automated.\n\nthe amount of work that any single person could do with a you know set of tractors or whatever is far more than it used to be with You know many many people with you know large labor is animals, you know mules or oxen or whatever it might be So, you know, we\u0027ve seen this for a long long time in lots of different fields. It\u0027s not you specific to anything You know, we\u0027ve seen the conversation that people have of you know within IT. You should automate more tasks maybe you\u0027re using a an ansible or a terraform or something like that and\n\nYou know, again, same sort of things. could be replacement of task. could be augmentation of task.

we\u0027ve also seen for a long time that management or owners of businesses have always tried to replace workers with technology where possible. Because again, you could argue lots of reasons for doing it, but at the most bottom line reasons, when you\u0027ve got sort of technology as opposed to people, the technology doesn\u0027t tend to get sick. You don\u0027t have to pay it over time. You don\u0027t have to pay it for vacation. You don\u0027t necessarily have to pay things like\n\ntaxes, social security taxes, other sort of safety net taxes, insurance, all those sort of things. Yes, you do have to maintain the equipment. It does have bugs and technology problems and all that kind of stuff. But the perception is the more you could leverage technology as opposed to humans, if you were just looking at it from a bottom line perspective, this has been a thing for a long, time. Even technology doesn\u0027t necessarily introduce this. We\u0027ve seen this in\n\nBrian Gracely (04:49.824)\nin factories, know, robotics in factories, building cars, all sorts of stuff. Right. So again, this isn\u0027t specific to, you know, new technology, i.e. just AI, right. We\u0027ve seen this for decades and decades and centuries and centuries. So I think what I\u0027m kind of getting at and what I\u0027ve seen lately is a couple of interesting things. So I had a conversation with a couple of different companies out at events over the last couple of weeks, and one of them was sort of interesting. This was a company who had\n\nhas rolled out a decent amount of AI. In fact, they highlight it on their website and other types of things. So really good for kind of showcasing what they\u0027ve done, showcasing what technology they\u0027ve used, regulated industry stuff. So allows their peers to sort of see what\u0027s going on there and so forth. And the conversation sort of like this. They had rolled out, like I said, a set of different technologies, some sort of chat bots, so some...\n\nhuman engagement stuff, some internal facing stuff, some external facing stuff, some stuff to augment software developers or operations people, some stuff to try and classify content and a whole bunch of things, your kind of sweet spot bread and butter, low hanging fruit, gen AI stuff. And what was interesting was as we were talking about things and where they were going and some of the stuff that they were looking to do, they brought up an interesting question. said, hey, we\n\nwe have rolled out a lot of stuff. And one of the metrics of success that we\u0027ve used is adoption rate. So for example, in one of the areas they had rolled it out to X number of thousands of people. And one of the measurements they were using was what was the adoption rate either on a daily basis or weekly basis again, it depended on the task and so forth. And, and so they were seeing, you know, relatively high adoption rates, I think it was in them, you know, plus 60%, maybe it was closer to 70 or 80%. And\n\nthey were using that metric. And then what they were running into was so on one hand, they felt like they had gone through all the things that you normally should go through in terms of, is this viable technology? Have we put certain things in place to be able to sort of track it from an accuracy perspective, hallucinations? Are we aware of who\u0027s using it? And are we putting certain things in place to make sure that the wrong information doesn\u0027t get in the system? So they.\n\nBrian Gracely (07:11.618)\nThey\u0027d kind of gone through, you know, we think we\u0027ve done a lot of the right things. Again, still early days recognizing that the things can get better. What was interesting was their initial measurement was what was going to be the adoption rate. And I think the reason for that and what they sort of started telling me was they had sort of been told by the people who provided the technology to them. This wasn\u0027t sort of all homegrown. They had used a vendor and an outside party to sort of drive some of this stuff.\n\nwas that they had said, the success rate you\u0027re going to see is something like 50 to 60 % greater output as a whole. So augmenting the people that are going to be using this technology by 50%, 60%. And this was based on what the provider had used in whatever studies they had measured.

reason this sort of came up was they felt like, okay, we use that number to then build a business case for adoption of what they wanted to do. And part of the business case was also reaching this level of adoption in terms of volume, right? So like I said, the 60 to 80 % usage. And what they sort of came back with was they said, well, what we\u0027re seeing is we\u0027re not necessarily seeing\n\nthat much additional productivity, right? And they gave me a different number. just assume it\u0027s less than the 60 to 80 % or 50 something percent greater productivity. Maybe it was 20 % or 15 % or 30%, whatever it was, it wasn\u0027t that level. And what was interesting to me was the conversation wasn\u0027t about how do you think we could get the level of additional efficiency up? They said,\n\nwe\u0027re now starting to be asked by senior management, how do we then, how do we go from like 50 or 60, know, whatever they were at, let\u0027s just call it 30 % just so we can talk in the same thing, right? Like 30 % greater efficiency to replacing the people. And, you know, as we were talking about it, it didn\u0027t feel like a radical conversation, right? This wasn\u0027t an organization that was, or, you know, the couple of organizations we talked about, they weren\u0027t, you know, a company that was like,\n\nBrian Gracely (09:40.042)\nMassively venture funded and so they felt this huge pressure because they had a huge valuation This was a very stable company a well-established company had been in place for a very long time but it was very interesting that they were sort of jumping to this thing of I Didn\u0027t I didn\u0027t get to where I was initially and I want these the technology providers To help me get from let\u0027s just call it that that 25 or 30 percent additional efficiency to a hundred percent\n\nwhen the initial number that they had built their business around was like 50%. And I thought it was sort of fascinating to sort of hear the logic behind this. And I think the reason I bring this sort of stuff up is, and I\u0027ll kind of walk through what we then talked about was, I think there is potentially a very growing feeling that if you\u0027re doing this sort of part way, you\u0027re not gonna get there.\n\nOr you\u0027re going to go through a lot of work to not necessarily get there and you need to set your goals higher. And I\u0027m not necessarily saying that\u0027s the right way of doing it. I\u0027m simply saying, I\u0027m starting to get this feeling. And the reason I say this is I feel like so much of what we\u0027ve seen in the AI market to date has been kind of the, the narrative of it has been driven by a very small number of companies, very, very large companies, very huge amounts of funding or able to put a lot of money into what they\u0027re doing.\n\nAnd they\u0027re talking about it in the context of enormous, enormous amounts of change in very, very small amounts of time. And I point to things like we hear whoever it is, whether it\u0027s OpenAI or Anthropic or one of the leading sort of AI labs saying, hey, we are just around the corner from AGI. Maybe we\u0027ve already reached AGI or super AGI.\n\nthese labs that are saying like, we\u0027ve already sort of reached that. We\u0027re literally right around the corner from this. And so I think that has sort of accelerated people\u0027s perspective on when is this thing going to happen. But then we\u0027re also starting to see all these conversations happen again, whether it\u0027s the O\u0027Reilly group saying, hey, software development will never be the same again, or we\u0027re hearing we no longer need software developers. We\u0027re already hearing we\u0027re not going to need operations because there\u0027s going to be these agents.\n\nBrian Gracely (12:06.958)\nWe\u0027re hearing over and over again in different industries, like there won\u0027t be entry level people. We\u0027re seeing certain companies, I think it was either Spotify or Airbnb or somebody this week, their CEO had sent out a notice, a memo, an internal sort of thing saying, we\u0027re no longer hiring people until you can prove that you\u0027ve exhausted all of your resources using some sort of AI tool to do the thing that that person could do. Hence, you\u0027ve proven above and

can do, what AI can do to then hire another person. And again, whether that\u0027s the right thing to do or not the right way to do it, we do tend to see certain trends, certain sort of herd mentality happen in the technology industry. And I think because, especially given what\u0027s going on in the economy right now, whether it\u0027s bumpy or we\u0027re headed down a path of, you\n\nrecession and all those sort of things that people are talking about right now. People become the sort of fodder in how to fix these things. And so I think it\u0027s really interesting just to sort of watch that. We\u0027ve seen OpenAI now talk about having these PhD level agents that they\u0027re going to charge $20,000 a month to be able to do very high level tasks, which I think is interesting. Like before, everything had sort of been, you this thing can\n\ncan help with low level tasks. Now we\u0027re starting to see sort of rhetoric about kind of attacking the higher level, high value jobs and so forth. But on the flip side, we\u0027re also starting to see companies struggle with this. So I put a couple of links in the show notes there for a couple of articles and the information, which in some cases, the things are published in front of the paywall and behind the paywall. People know how to get around them, but I put links to them.\n\nAI, the analysis that Salesforce with their agent force, their new sort of AI technology is really struggling to provide people with sort of replacement types of technology. you know, we talked about this a while ago. You can tell a little bit about where a technology company is sort of placing their expectation of the technology based on how they price it. Right. So for example, most of the Microsoft\n\nBrian Gracely (14:31.372)\nsort of co-pilot types of things are done on a per seat basis. And if you kind of map that out, you would assume, well, if their growth is on a per seat basis, their goal wouldn\u0027t be to reduce the number of seats, i.e. the number of people, but more so to get you to pay more per seat. But again, sort of in the augmenting people category of how pricing\u0027s laid out. Salesforce, on the other hand, is done not on a per seat basis, which is the way previous sort of Salesforce types of things, know, access to the\n\nknow, customer records and all that kind of CRM stuff was done per seat. This is now being done on a per task basis. So for example, if you\u0027re doing this as a customer service type of agent, it\u0027s like $2 per query, right? So every time, you know, one of your customers engages with customer service, it\u0027s like two bucks for Salesforce, right? So that is very much intended to be like a replacement type of technology, right? And people can do the math of like, what is a normal customer service agent call, you know, cost and how many\n\nInquiries do you have and what\u0027s the average number of of inquiries per you know per engagement or all that sort of stuff and you can you can figure out the math but they\u0027re apparently sort of struggling with that and So I think it\u0027s I think it\u0027s gonna be very very interesting to watch the way in which Both the technology companies as well as the Using companies the end user companies are sort of looking at this and I do kind of get this sense that\n\nthere is beginning to be a little bit of a trend or a little bit of an exploration of how do we make this more replacement oriented. And I think it\u0027s a difficult situation. And sort of one of the conversations that we kind of had as I was talking to some of these people is I said, look, in many cases, you\u0027re not going to necessarily hear the technology companies. And the more I think about this, maybe this isn\u0027t necessarily right. I think you\u0027re going to hear\n\na set of technology companies saying, we\u0027re here to augment what you do, right? And how much you augment that, how aggressively you augment that is completely up to you. I think you\u0027re going to hear a different category of technology providers. And again, this could be consulting companies.

Gracely (16:54.158)\npushing more and more this idea of sort of replacement because that number one doesn\u0027t necessarily have a timeline on it. And two, know, if you\u0027re, you know, if you\u0027re a business or you\u0027re somebody valuing the company like that, that may seem like a greater possibility of, of huge valuation somewhere in the future than it does sort of saying, well, everybody\u0027s going to kind of get 20 % better, 15 % better, 10 % better or 40 % better, whatever that might be.\n\nSo I think it\u0027d be very, very interesting to sort of watch that. I think the discussion that we ended up having was, what do you, as the end customer, want from your discussion? not from discussion, what do you want from the goal of whatever your project is? And I think where we kind of netted out, without going into all the detail, was we sort of said, I think you\u0027ve got to be very careful in terms of where the message of what the goals are comes from and how fine grain you get to.\n\nRight. So for example, we were just sort of talking about like building applications just as a, as a category. Right. And I said, on one hand, you know, if, if you\u0027re sort of pushing the idea of, we want our current development team or even, you know, future development team, you know, that are working on things that differentiate your business to continue to be valued within the company. The conversation you\u0027re probably going to have is how do we augment them? Right. How do we take you from, from an excellent\n\nteam, an excellent developer to do it even better. One who can offload certain tasks, maybe it\u0027s writing tests or whatever it might be, documentation to somebody who is able to, in some iteration, in some future iteration, able to spend more time thinking about architecture, thinking about ways in which you can differentiate the business through user experience or whatever it might be.\n\nsort of holistically saying, we want to, we want to eliminate the need for software developers in our company, right? Maybe you\u0027re thinking, we want to go all low, all low code, we\u0027re going to give, you know, business analysts and product managers and salespeople, the ability to just sort of go, hey, whenever I got an idea, I can work with this tool, and it will write some software for me. And my goal out of that is, let\u0027s, let\u0027s sort of shift.\n\nBrian Gracely (19:22.882)\nmaybe it\u0027s shifting, maybe it\u0027s replacing those tasks that used to go into the queue that some software developer would build to maintain and we\u0027re sort of pushing them out to something else. Or maybe we\u0027re just simply pushing them to, you know, some sort of agent in the future, one of these super agents in the future, and they\u0027re going to do that. And the reason I kind of put these two side by side is if you\u0027re granular in how you\u0027re explaining what you\u0027re trying to do, you can avoid the problem of like,\n\nyou know, do we kill morale in across the board when we\u0027re really only trying to target certain things? Are we measuring the success of an augmentation or the metrics of an augmentation in the same way that we measure sort of a replacement or shifting type of thing? And this is where we sort of got into, you know, a lot of this really is going to depend on the leadership of the company, what their goals are, how they communicate things, you know, how they are, you know, because this is huge, huge sort of\n\nyou know, shifting, changing what people do. Right. And we\u0027re seeing more and more articles come out about, know, just using the developer use case of, know, what does that challenge mean? What does that new environment look like, depending on what the management push is? Right. And I\u0027ll put a link in the show notes. There was very interesting article recently of kind of a company who had kind of gone all in because the leader of the team had said, I\u0027m going all in myself. And so think the rest of you should kind of go all in.\n\nAnd the scope of what they did in their day-to-day stuff is just a manager, limited coding, more using the tools for other types of things. Taking that mindset and pushing it down onto the development team was having all sorts of weird, adverse, unexpected kind of behaviors. So anyways, I\u0027ll put a link to that in show notes. Again, it\u0027s just, again, one example, one data point.

to bubble up a little bit. again, technology in and of itself is sometimes very interesting. It has certain characteristics. But technology always has certain byproducts, if you will, certain ripple effects that happen because of what\u0027s going on with the economy. So if the economy is struggling, we tend to look for technology to kind of help us improve the bottom line.\n\nBrian Gracely (21:47.93)\nkind of reduce, we think more in the reduction or elimination sort of mindset. When things are going well, and we\u0027ve seen this with companies growing and VC funding, we tend to think in the innovation and growth sort of mindset. So the technology is never sort of in and of itself in a vacuum. So with that, I would love to kind of hear feedback from folks. I try and use a lot of these weekend perspectives as both.\n\nyou know, kind of things that I\u0027m hearing out in the marketplace. But, you know, I\u0027d love for them to be, you know, kind of feedback mechanisms from you. Like, what are, what are you hearing in your organizations? As you talk to people across the marketplace, across the industry, at different events or different, you know, meetups and community things and so forth? Where are you seeing in terms of the spectrum? Are people, are companies, you know, trying to do more in terms of augmentation with AI? Are they trying to do more sort of\n\nshifting or replacement with AI, what are the things that are driving that? What are the things that they may start down the path of saying, hey, we\u0027re looking to do replacement, and certain unexpected things, organizational things, certain process things, certain psychological things are kind of getting in that way, or allowing it to happen, because it is different than they maybe would have expected. anyways.\n\nJust again, not sort of a perspective is more of an observation this weekend. Just some stuff I\u0027ve seen over the last couple of weeks and it does get me sort of thinking of like, I think we\u0027re gonna have to be a little more flexible, a little more understanding of just the dynamics that this is not just what can the technology do, but what is the impact in terms of people understanding what your goals are, people accepting what your goals are, people.\n\nyou know, measuring themselves as individuals against what tools can do. You know, people tend to have very high expectations of themselves or, or, you know, beliefs in themselves versus being very critical of what things that either could augment or replace certain things can do. And, you know, we see this with technology all the time. So really curious what other people are seeing. Just some stuff that I\u0027ve started to see as I, you know, deal with, with companies and talk to people around the world and so forth. So anyways, with that, wrap it up.\n\nBrian Gracely (24:09.984)\nHope everybody\u0027s doing well.
